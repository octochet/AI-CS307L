# Artificial Intelligence Assignment

Team: Chetan Moturi(CS21B017) and MVSK Karthikeya(CS21B033)

The Projects:

1. TSP using variable neighbour search and simulated annealing
2. Sokoban using DFS branch and bound   

## Travelling Salesman Problem using NS & SA

- The traveling salesperson problem (TSP) is a touring problem in which each city must be visited exactly once. 
- The aim is to ﬁnd the shortest tour. The problem is known to be NP-hard.
- More Formally, Given a graph in which the nodes are cities, to find a cycle containing each city exactly once, such that the total cost of the tour is as low as possible.
